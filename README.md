# Banking-System
A simple Banking System has been implemented with the help of C++ functions, classes and basic STL. 

**Following functionalities are allowed in this Banking System:**
1. Open an Account in the Bank
2. Balance Enquiry of the Account
3. Deposit amount in a Bank Account
4. Withdrawal of amount from a Bank Account
5. Close a Bank Account
6. Show All existing Accounts

Also, Banking System saves the data of accounts in **bankdata.txt** and loads it when it is run again. Thus, no data is lost when one runs the code for the second time.
